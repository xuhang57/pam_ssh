* Unit testing

Honor a special line in pam.conf for testing various configurations.
The test keys can be stored in the distribution.

* Compatibility with SSH Communications Security's product

** Remove dependencies on OpenSSH code

Instead of calling OpenSSH's load_private_key(), execute ssh-add in the
authentication phase and something like

       ssh-agent ssh-add

in the session phase and parse the output.  (SSH's ssh-add provides
decent return values, whereas OpenSSH's does not.)

* Make more configurable

** .ssh subdir path option in pam.conf

** Binary path option in pam.conf

Search a colon-separated path for the SSH binaries.
