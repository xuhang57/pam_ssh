Version 2.3
===========

* minor cleanup
  - removal of obsolete .ssh/identity handling
  - documentation updates
  - typo fixes

Version 2.2
===========

Compatibility

* support openssl 1.1 while trying to stay compatible with 1.0)
* removed SHA1 and SSH1 support


Version 2.1
===========

General improvements and bugfixes

* session/login/default keys lexical sort order
* add ED25519 key support
* updated openssh embedded code to 6.7p1


Version 2.01
============

Minor doc enhancements

* no code changes


Version 2.0
===========

General improvements and bugfixes

* added support for ECDSA keys
* ssh-agent is now spawned in a different improved way
* ssh-agent is not started anymore for users without keys
* support try_first_password PAM option
* still ask for passphrase even if user does not exist
* expect keys used for login in ~/.ssh/login-keys.d directory
  (see README; this behaviour will cause old setups to fail
  since the default keys are not used anymore for auth)
* "keyfiles" option has been removed and all found keys
  which can be opened using the provided passphrase will be
  added to the agent
* alternative keys not used for login purposes and not named
  like the default keys will be decrypted and saved for the
  agent when placed in ~/.ssh/session-keys.d directory
* when there is no controlling tty now use the PID to
  create the session file
* return PAM_SESSION_ERR from within the session part
  instead of PAM_AUTH_ERR
* honour TMPDIR when starting ssh-agent
* start ssh-agent with GID of the group given at
  compile time to the new configure option
  --with-ssh-agent-group


Version 1.98
============

Fixed some possible crashes and minor issues:

* Under some conditions, there is a double-free bug
  in pam_ssh. The data of the "ssh_agent_env_agent"
  pam_handle_t's item may have been free'd without being
  nullified, which trigger a bug on the cleanup phase.
  (ticket #13 double-free bug with pam_ssh-1.97)
* Before executing ssh-agent, pam_ssh restores root
  privileges with openpam_restore_cred, then uses only setuid
  to adjust privileges. Thus ssh-agent runs with gid 0.
  (ticket #12 pam_ssh doesn't set gid/groups before executing ssh-agent)
* Clear signal mask before executing ssh-agent as
  pam_ssh code can be called from kdm with blocked TERM signal
  which would be inherited by ssh-agent
* fixed crash caused by EOF password
  (ticket 14 pam_ssh segfaults on abort with empty password)


Version 1.97
============

SECURITY FIX: pam_ssh used a certain prompt if a user found to exist
to ask for the SSH passphrase explicitely depending on whether the
username was valid or invalid, which made it easier for remote
attackers to enumerate usernames. (CVE-2009-1273)


**********************************************************************
* The pam_ssh maintained on Novell's DeveloperNet got merged back    *
* to SourceForge with Version 1.96 and syncs both up to the same     *
* level. The DeveloperNet version isn't going to maintained further  *
* http://developer.novell.com/wiki/index.php/Pam_ssh                 *
**********************************************************************

Version 1.96 (Novell DeveloperNet)
============

SECURITY FIX: The allow_blank_passphrase option was defeatable simply
by entering a random but non-blank passphrase.  Thanks to Rob
Henderson for the report.

Version 1.95 (Novell DeveloperNet)
============

Bugfix release to avoid double-free and and a null-pointer dereference
issues.

Version 1.94 (Novell DeveloperNet)
============

Improved logging and bugfix release with improved recovery after
system crashes.

Version 1.93 (Novell DeveloperNet)
============

The option to allow blank passphrases is now 'nullok' while the old
option is still available but deprecated.
The debug option is now really supported as documented.
We didn't start the ssh-agent if the close_session module wasn't  called
correctly but the ssh-agent was killed (e.g. system crashes).
That should be solved in almost all cases now.

Version 1.92 (Novell DeveloperNet)
============

The module is usable now for session use only if wanted. It starts
an ssh-agent without adding keys to it in that case.

Version 1.92 (SourceForge)
============

SECURITY FIX: The allow_blank_passphrase option was defeatable simply
by entering a random but non-blank passphrase.  Thanks to Rob
Henderson for the report.

Version 1.91
============

Don't allow blank passphrases by default.  Add option
allow_blank_passphrase to re-enable them.  Thanks to red0x for the
suggestion.

Version 1.9
===========

Code cleanup release.  Updated OpenSSH compatibility code to 3.7.1p2.
Updated for newer Autoconf and Automake.  Plus we use Autoheader now.

Version 1.8
===========

This version is more portable about the way it juggles user IDs when
starting the agent.  As a result, it works on Linux systems.  Also,
it tries to run as the user rather than root as much as possible.

Other portability changes were made--pam_ssh should now work on
Mac OS X systems.

Version 1.7
===========

Mark R V Murray of the FreeBSD project wrote a manual page, which we
now include in the distribution.

We now use Automake, Autoconf, and Libtool.  I think a guy named Trey
donated most of the Autoconf logic, which I probably ended up marring
beyond recognition.  Trey, if you're out there, drop me another note
so I can give you proper credit.

In this version we fixed a bunch of bugs and added support for OpenPAM
and pam_std_option(), all thanks to FreeBSD.  The OpenSSH code has
been updated to 3.4p1.

Version 1.6
===========

Only one agent is started per user per host.  Thanks to
<hmh@debian.org> for this idea.  Each agent has an associated file
with environment data (.ssh/agent-<hostname>).  When a concurrent
session is started, the session phase need only pass this environment
data to the application rather than starting a new agent and adding
the keys.  A filename (.ssh/agent-<host>-<tty> or
.ssh/agent-<host>-<display>) is hard linked to this environment file
for each session to keep a reference count of the number of sessions
using the agent.  Only when the count drops to zero is the agent
killed.

Added keyfiles option to specify which key files to use for
authentication.  Only these keys will be given to the agent in the
session phase.

Updated OpenSSH code to version 2.9p2.
